All the components are marked on the PCB, you shall not miss anything. If you have question, ask first, solder later!

4x	100nF, 1# (min 16V, I use X7R or the disc ones. Both are fine and cheap)
1x	22uF, 1# (4mm diameter, 16V, I use submini, 4x7mm)
1x	47uF, 1# (5mm diameter, 16V, I use submini, 5x7mm)
2x	1N4148 diode, 2#
1x	resistor 1k, 3#
1x	resistor 4k7, 3#
1x	resistor 5k1, 3#
1x	resistor 10k, 3#
1x	resistor bridge, 10k, 8+1pin
1x	47pF, 1# (disc form)
1x	68pF, 1# (disc form)
1x	3mm red LED
1x3	pin header + 1x jumper (RAM selector: it is either set to 512kB or less)

(LS or HCT, whichever you can get cheaper)
1x 	74HCT32 	(+ DIP-14 socket)
1x 	74HCT74 	(+ DIP-14 socket)
1x 	74HCT123	(+ DIP-16 socket)
1x 	74HCT273	(+ DIP-20 socket)
1x 	DIP-32 socket
3x 	PLCC-32 through-hole socket (non-SMD!!)

1x	SST39SF010A (128kB flash)
2x	SST39SF040 (512kB flash)

1x	HM628128 (128kB SRAM). Optional, currently no SW uses the onboard RAM...

I believe it is worth seating the chips in sockets, though the logic ones are not necessary to do so.

You can order SRAM from ebay, or new ones (AS6C1008). If you buy from ebay (probably used one - a lot cheaper) then use precision DIP-32 slot instead of the cheap one.

1# means 2.54mm distance (1 raster)
3# means 3x2.54mm distance (3 raster)

Before soldering in the 5k1 resistor, check if the LED is bright enough for you! 5k1 for red LED is OK for me, but you might get different LED supplies...
