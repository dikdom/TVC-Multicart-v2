FLASH

PLA
This chip is responsible for activating-deactivating the right component on the Multicart, based on the containing image.
Write the  tvc-pla.bin  image to the 128kB Flash (SST39SF010A). If you use a 512kB flash for the PLA, then write the image into the last (upper) 128kB block.
The PLA chip on the Multicart is the left side PLCC-32 IC, it is alone on the left side of the PCB.


ROM
The two chips contains the usable extension of the TVC machine in 16kB banks. The first 16kB bank is special, it contains the firmware of the Multicart and
the BAM, the block allocation map of the files. The rest of the flash memory chips contains the files which can be loaded.
The first IC is on the left one, the second IC is the right one, out of the remaining two sockets. 

Use the windows program to create the two image files for the flash chips.
First select the size of your flash chips (512kB - 512kB)
Then make sure that the correct firmware is selected with the required language.
Then add the files you want your Multicart to contain:
 - you can add cartridge (bin, cart) files.
 - you can add .cas files
You can edit the name of the files and the order of the files.

Generate the two image files and use your favourite burner to burn the flash chips.



Please note, that you can use AM29F040 chips also, but in this case you will not be able to save files to the cart from TVC BASIC.
